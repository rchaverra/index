# Pebble Mobile app

## Index Phone fork

This branch adds an Android phone-only mode that runs the existing Index experience without an
Index 01 ring. It launches directly into the Index feed, creates the standard lists locally, uses
on-device speech and agent models by default, and maps the phone's Volume Up button to the existing
configurable Index gestures.

Read the complete [Index Phone Getting Started Guide](INDEX_PHONE_GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Getting started on Android

1. Install and open **Index** once.
2. Allow microphone access.
3. Open Android **Accessibility** settings and enable **Index Volume Up**.
4. Keep the default **Hold & Talk → Index agent** setting, or choose another available action in
   Index settings.
5. Hold Volume Up to record, then release it to send the recording through the existing Index
   processing pipeline.

The public Android accessibility path works while the tested Pixel Fold and Motorola Razr+ 2024
outer display are awake, including from the Home screen, another foreground app, and the awake lock
screen. Android did not deliver Volume Up events after either device entered screen-off/doze. The
optional **Screen-off headset recording** setting provides a disabled-by-default media-button
fallback, pending physical headset testing. A quiet foreground-service notification is required for
reliable background microphone access and may remain visible in Android's notification shade or
Active apps panel.

The Android application ID is `com.ricardochaverra.index`, so it can coexist with the upstream
Core Devices app. Cloud-dependent features still require a compatible signed-in backend account;
local recording, transcription, agent processing, notes, lists, reminders, alarms, and timers work
without one in the validated phone-mode paths.

Welcome to the official source code for the Pebble mobile app. Download the app from the [iOS Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pebble-core/id6743771967) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coredevices.coreapp&hl=en_US). The app is entirely open source. 

This app supports ALL Pebble watches, and Pebble Index 01 rings.

**Note: this is a public copy of our internal repo, where we do active development; it is synced regularly, but this process is manual so it may lag behind.

# Architecture

**New to Pebble?** A Pebble watch runs its own firmware and its own apps/watchfaces, but has no internet connection of its own. This app is the watch's companion and gateway to the world: it holds a persistent Bluetooth connection (BLE, or Bluetooth Classic on older watches) to relay notifications, sync data (time, weather, calendar, contacts, health), install watchapps, and proxy network requests on the watch's behalf. Much of the app's job is to be a reliable background service that stays connected and answers the watch quickly.

The codebase is **Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform**: one shared codebase — including the UI — builds both the Android and iOS apps. Almost everything lives in `commonMain`; platform-specific pieces (BLE stack, notification access, background execution) sit behind `expect`/`actual` interfaces. On iOS, `iosApp` is a thin Swift shell that embeds the shared Kotlin code as a framework via CocoaPods.

Watch communication lives in `libpebble3` and follows a few core concepts:

- **Pebble Protocol** — a binary, endpoint-based message protocol spoken over the Bluetooth connection. Packet definitions live in `libpebble3` under `io/rebble/libpebblecommon/packets/`.
- **Services & endpoint managers** — both scoped to a single watch connection. Services translate raw protocol messages into typed APIs for the rest of the app; endpoint managers handle the more complex stateful flows on top of them.
- **BlobDB** — the watch keeps small key-value databases (notifications, timeline pins, installed apps, contacts, …). The phone keeps the canonical copy of each record in a Room database and reconciles with the watch over the protocol (mostly phone → watch, with some watch-originated writebacks). The `blobannotations` + `blobdbgen` modules generate the serialization/sync plumbing via KSP.
- **PebbleKit JS** — watchapps can include a JavaScript component that runs on the *phone*, inside this app (`js/`), giving watchapps network access and configuration UIs.

Module map:

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `composeApp` | App entry point: Compose UI, navigation, DI wiring (Koin), Firebase |
| `libpebble3` | Everything needed to talk to a Pebble watch: BLE transport, protocol, services, BlobDB sync. Also usable as a standalone library |
| `pebble` | Pebble app features shared between platforms, above the library layer |
| `experimental` | Pebble Index 01 (ring) support: continuous BLE scanning, voice-note recording and ingestion |
| `index-ai` | The "Index" AI assistant and its data layer (transcription, notes) |
| `libindex` | Index device plumbing: pairing, transfer, storage |
| `mcp` | MCP (Model Context Protocol) client/tool integration |
| `cactus`, `resampler`, `krisp-stubs` | Audio/ML support: on-device LLM inference, audio resampling, and API stubs for the private Krisp noise-cancellation integration |
| `blobannotations`, `blobdbgen` | KSP annotations + code generator for BlobDB records |
| `util` | Shared utilities (logging, IO, …) |

Stack at a glance: Koin (DI), Ktor (HTTP), Room (storage), Kermit (logging), coroutines/Flow throughout.

# Mobile App

The cross-platform Pebble mobile app is located in `composeApp`.

Several features (e.g. bug reporting, google login, memfault, online transcription, github developer connection) will not work without tokens configured in `gradle.properties` (but all core features do work).

### Android
* Compile on Android with `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleRelease`.
* You will need a `google-services.json` in `androidApp/src` to compile on Android (an examples with dummy values is provided in `google-services-dummy.json`).
* You will need a keystore with some keys if you intend to do a release build on Android (unless you use `LOCAL_RELEASE_BUILD=true` in `gradle.properties`).

### iOS

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Java 17**

   ```bash
   # Install
   brew install openjdk@17
   
   # Symlink (optional)
   sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.jdk
   
   # Verify installation
   /usr/libexec/java_home -v 17
   ```

2. **Install CocoaPods**

   ```bash
   # Install
   brew install cocoapods
   
   # Symlink (optional)
   sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/pod /usr/local/bin/pod
   ```

3. **Install Android Studio**

   The Gradle build needs an Android SDK even when only building for iOS
   (several modules apply the Android Gradle plugin). Install
   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and let its
   setup wizard install the SDK at the default location
   (`~/Library/Android/sdk`).

   Then create a `local.properties` file in the project root pointing at it:

   ```properties
   sdk.dir=/Users/<you>/Library/Android/sdk
   ```

4. **Install the iOS platform for Xcode**

   Recent Xcode versions ship without the iOS platform (SDK device
   support and simulator runtime). Without it, any iOS build fails with
   "iOS X.Y is not installed". Download it with:

   ```bash
   xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
   ```

   (This is the same ~8 GB download as Xcode → Settings → Components.)

#### Configuration

5. **Configure Entitlements**

   Set `iosApp/iosApp/iosApp.entitlements` to:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
      <dict>
         <key>com.apple.developer.healthkit</key>
         <true/>
      </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

6. **Install CocoaPods dependencies**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew podInstall
   ```

   This will create `Podfile.lock` and set up all required dependencies.

7. **Configure Bundle ID and Signing**

   - Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode (⚠️ **Important**: use `.xcworkspace`, not `.xcodeproj`)
   - Go to the target `iosApp` → **Signing & Capabilities**
   - Set your **Team** (your Apple Developer account)
   - Set **Bundle Identifier** to your own (e.g., `com.yourname.coredevices.coreapp`)

8. **Configure Firebase**

   - Create a free Firebase account at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Create a new iOS app with the same Bundle ID you set above
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `iosApp/iosApp/`
   - The file should be named exactly `GoogleService-Info.plist`

   If you don't need any Firebase-dependent features, you can skip the
   Firebase account and use the provided dummy config instead (same as
   `google-services-dummy.json` on Android):

   ```bash
   cp iosApp/iosApp/GoogleService-Info-dummy.plist iosApp/iosApp/GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```

9. **Create a git tag for app version**

   Create a git tag that will be used as the version of the app:

   ```bash
   git tag 1.0.0
   ```

#### Build and Run

10. **Build and run in Xcode**

   - Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Select your target device or simulator and run.

   > **Tip**: If you encounter module not found errors (`Mixpanel`, `FirebaseCore`, etc.), make sure you:
   > - Opened the `.xcworkspace` file (not `.xcodeproj`)
   > - Ran `pod install` successfully
   > - Cleaned the build folder (`Product → Clean Build Folder`)

   > **Known issue**: simulator builds currently fail to link with
   > `ld: building for 'iOS-simulator', but linking in object file (...libspeex.a...) built for 'iOS'`.
   > The published `io.github.coredevices.speex` simulator artifact ships a
   > device-built `libspeex.a` inside its iosSimulatorArm64 klib (every
   > version on Maven Central is affected) and needs to be republished.
   > Until then, run on a physical device. Note the simulator has no
   > Bluetooth in any case, so connecting a watch requires a device.




# Naming your project

In order to honour the Pebble trademark, you may not use "Pebble" in the name of your app, product or service, except in a referential manner. For example, "Awesome App for Pebble" is acceptable, but "Pebble Awesome" is not.

# Contributing

Pebble employs several (extremely busy) full time mobile developers to work on this app. If you'd like to contribute, we welcome PRs but caution you that it may take us some time before we can review your PR. Please be patient with us :)

# Reporting bugs

Please use the built-in bug report feature in the Pebble app by going to Settings > Get Help > New Bug Report instead of Github issues, as the internal bug reports contain more information for us to debug most issues. 

# Development Guidelines

(We don't follow all of these everywhere, yet, and need to document a lot more..)

- We share a version catalog with CoreApp to avoid duplicating definitions. This means a few extra library entries which are not used in libpebble (so they can share the version definition).
- Use `optIn` in `build.gradle.kts` rather than individual source files.
- Only use injected coroutine scopes: either LibPebbleCoroutineScope (instead of GlobalScope) or ConnectionCoroutineScope (scoped per-connection).

Connection:
- Services are scoped to the connection. Their main job is to translate raw pebble protocol messages to something readable by the rest of the app.
- Endpoint managers are also scoped to the connection, and manage complex state around services.
